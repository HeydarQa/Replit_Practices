Instructions from your teacher:
Write a a method appearsTwice() that returns true if value of variable target appears only twice in the string sentence, otherwise return false.

Examples:
Main.appearsTwice("java", "java is fun!")
      - returns false, because java appears only once.

Main.appearsTwice("laptop", "I would like to buy a new laptop, because my laptop is too old.")
      - returns true, because laptop appears twice.
